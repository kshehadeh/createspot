If you want to limit who can interact with you, you can block users. Blocked users cannot follow you (or remain unfollowed if they were already following you).

## Blocking a follower

From the Community page: **My Hub** → **Community** → **Followers** tab. Find the person you want to block and click **Block**. They are moved to your blocked list and no longer follow you.

## Unblocking someone

Open **My Hub** → **Community** → **Blocked** tab. Find the person you want to unblock and click **Unblock**. They can follow you again if they choose.

## What blocking does

- Blocked users cannot follow you.
- If they were already following you, they are automatically unfollowed.
- They do not receive notifications when you block them.
- You can unblock them anytime from the Blocked tab.
