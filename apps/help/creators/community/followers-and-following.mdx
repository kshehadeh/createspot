You can follow creators whose work you enjoy. When you follow someone, you can get notified when they post new work. When someone follows you, they can get notified when you post.

## Following creators

From any creator's profile page (when logged in), click **Follow** to follow them. The button changes to **Unfollow** while you're following; click it again to unfollow.

You can also manage who you follow from the Community page: open **My Hub** → **Community** → **Following** tab. Use the **Unfollow** button next to anyone you want to stop following.

## Who follows you

See your followers on the Community page: **My Hub** → **Community** → **Followers** tab. Each entry shows the creator's name and avatar; click to visit their profile.

## Email notifications

You can control two types of email notifications in **Profile** → **Edit profile**:

- **Someone follows you** — Get an email when someone new follows you.
- **New work from people you follow** — Get an email when someone you follow adds new work to their portfolio.

Both are on by default. Turn them off anytime in the profile editor if you prefer fewer emails.

## Profile analytics

Your profile analytics (visible when you view your own profile) show your follower and following counts. These help you see how your community is growing.
