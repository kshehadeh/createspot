Submissions are the pieces you add in response to weekly prompts. You can create new ones, edit existing ones (where allowed), and manage what appears in your portfolio.

## Adding a submission

1. Go to the current week's prompt (e.g. from **Play** or **Inspiration**).
2. Choose **Submit** or **Add your work**.
3. Upload a photo or add text as required by the prompt type.
4. Add an optional title or caption if the form allows.
5. Submit. The piece is saved and linked to that prompt and to your profile.

You can submit to the current prompt while it's active. Past prompts may be view-only depending on app settings.

## Work in Progress submissions

Sometimes you want to share your creative journey before the final piece is done. **Work in Progress (WIP)** submissions let you do exactly that.

### When to use WIP

- You're still working on a piece and want to document your process
- You have progressions (steps along the way) but no final image or text yet
- You want viewers to know this is an evolving piece, not a finished work

### Creating a WIP submission

When adding a portfolio item, enable the **Work in Progress** toggle. This allows you to submit without a main image or text — your progressions become the primary content.

<Note>
WIP is different from a completed text-only work. A poem or essay with no image is a finished piece. WIP means "I'm not done yet" — the image or text is still coming.
</Note>

### How WIP submissions appear

WIP submissions have special visual indicators throughout the app:

- **Dashed border** — The tile has a dotted outline instead of a solid one
- **WIP badge** — An amber "WIP" badge appears on the tile
- **Progression thumbnail** — If you have progressions with images, the latest one shows as the thumbnail (slightly faded)

On the submission detail page, a WIP banner appears below the title, and the **Journey** tab is shown by default so viewers can see your progress.

## Progressions

Progressions are steps in your creative journey — early sketches, drafts, experiments leading to the final piece. Every submission can have progressions, whether it's a WIP or complete.

### Adding progressions

1. Open an existing submission for editing.
2. Scroll to the **Progressions** section.
3. Add images or text for each step, with optional comments describing what changed.

### Viewing progressions

On the submission page, progressions appear below the main content as a strip of thumbnails. Click any step to open the lightbox and view it full-size.

### Downloading as GIF

If your submission has at least two progression images, you can download them as an animated GIF from the download menu. The GIF shows each step in sequence, ending with your final piece.

## Editing a submission

If the app allows edits after submission:

- Open the submission (from your portfolio or prompt history) and use **Edit**.
- Change the image, text, or caption as needed and save.

Some fields (e.g. which prompt it's tied to) may not be editable after submit. If you don't see Edit, that submission may be locked.

## Removing a submission

You can usually remove a submission from your portfolio or from the prompt. Use **Delete** or **Remove** on the submission. Confirm the action; removal is typically permanent. The piece will no longer appear in your portfolio or in that prompt's gallery.

## Submissions and your profile

All your submissions form your portfolio. Your profile's **featured piece** can be set to one of these. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) and [Organizing your portfolio](/creators/portfolio/organizing-portfolio).
