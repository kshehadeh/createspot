Critiques on Create Spot help you grow as a creator by getting constructive feedback from the community, and help others by sharing your perspective.

## Requesting critiques

When you submit work, you can opt in to receive critiques:

- **Enable critiques** — When creating or editing a submission, toggle the option to allow critiques.
- **Be specific** — Add context about what kind of feedback you're looking for (composition, technique, concept, etc.).
- **Control visibility** — Critiques are visible based on your sharing level settings.

## Giving critiques

To leave feedback on someone's work:

- **Navigate to the piece** — Open the submission you want to critique.
- **Use the critique interface** — Look for the critique/feedback section.
- **Be constructive** — Focus on specific observations and suggestions rather than general praise or criticism.
- **Context helps** — Mention what works well and what could be improved, and why.

## Types of feedback

Critiques can include:

- **Written feedback** — Detailed comments on specific aspects of the work.
- **Selections** — Highlight specific areas of an image to reference in your feedback.
- **Overall impressions** — General thoughts on the piece's impact and effectiveness.

## Managing critiques

As a creator:

- **Review incoming feedback** — See all critiques on your work in one place.
- **Respond** — You can reply to critiques to ask clarifying questions or acknowledge feedback.
- **Disable if needed** — Turn off critiques on any piece if you prefer not to receive feedback.

## Community guidelines

- Keep feedback constructive and respectful.
- Focus on the work, not the person.
- Remember that creative work is personal; kindness matters.
