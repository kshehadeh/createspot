You can download your submissions by creating a [collection](/creators/portfolio/collections) and using the collection download features.

## How to download your work

Downloads happen through [**collections**](/creators/portfolio/collections), not directly from your portfolio:

- **Create a collection** — Go to your collections and create a new collection with the pieces you want to download.
- **Download from collection** — Open the collection and look for download options. You can typically download as:
  - **ZIP file** — All images in the collection bundled together.
  - **PDF** — A formatted document with your images.
  - **Social pack** — Images sized for social media sharing.

## What you get

- **Images** — Your uploaded files, possibly at display size. Watermarks, if you enabled them, will be included. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) for protection options.
- **Text** — Text submissions can be copied directly or included in PDF exports.

## Your protections and others' work

Your **download prevention** settings (if enabled) control how *others* can download *your* work. They don't prevent you from downloading your own submissions through your collections.

Don't download or reuse other creators' work without permission; respect their protections and preferences. See [A Word About AI](/a-word-about-ai).
