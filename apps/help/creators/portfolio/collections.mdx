Collections let you group related submissions into a curated set. Use them to organize work by theme, project, or purpose—and to download or share sets easily.

## Create a collection

1. Open **Collections** from your portfolio or profile menu.
2. Select **New collection**.
3. Add a title and (optional) description.
4. Choose the submissions you want to include.

## Manage a collection

- **Add or remove pieces** — Update which submissions appear in the collection.
- **Reorder** — Arrange the sequence to control how the collection is presented.
- **Update details** — Edit the title, description, or cover image if available.

## Download a collection

Collections are also the place to download your work:

- **ZIP** — All images in one archive.
- **PDF** — A formatted document of your pieces.
- **Social pack** — Images sized for sharing.

See [Downloading your work](/creators/portfolio/downloading-work) for details.
