Create Spot may offer ways for others to react to or comment on your work. Here’s how feedback typically works and where you’ll see it.

## Where feedback appears

- **On the piece** — Reactions (e.g. likes, hearts) or comments may appear on the submission page or in lightbox view.
- **In your portfolio** — Aggregated counts (e.g. total likes) might show next to each piece or in a summary.
- **Notifications** — If the app supports it, you may get notified when someone reacts or comments. See account or notification settings to control this.

## Types of feedback

- **Reactions** — Simple responses like a like or favorite. Usually one per user per piece.
- **Comments** — Text replies. May be moderated; follow community guidelines.

Feedback is from other logged-in users. Anonymous visitors may not be able to leave feedback depending on app settings.

## Using feedback

Use reactions and comments to see what resonates. You generally don’t need to do anything; feedback is visible on the piece and in your portfolio. If comments are enabled, you can reply in the thread. Report any abuse using the app’s reporting or contact options.
