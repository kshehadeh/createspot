Create Spot makes it easy to share your work on social media with beautiful preview cards that showcase your art.

## How sharing works

When you share a piece from your portfolio or a submission:

- **Rich previews** — The link generates a preview card with your image, title, and description that looks great on Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms.
- **Configurable metadata** — Each piece has its own title, description, and image that appear in the preview.
- **Direct links** — Every piece has a unique URL you can copy and share anywhere.

## Where to share from

- **Piece pages** — Open any submission and use the share button or copy the URL.
- **Your portfolio** — Share your portfolio link or individual pieces.
- **Prompt submissions** — Share your response to a prompt with the community.

## What people see

When someone clicks your shared link:

- If the piece is **public**: They see the full piece, details, and any public feedback.
- If the piece is **profile-only**: They see the piece if they're logged in; otherwise they may see a preview or login prompt depending on settings.
- If the piece is **private**: Only you can see it; sharing links won't work for others.

## Best practices

- Use clear, descriptive titles for better engagement.
- Add descriptions to give context about your work.
- Check your sharing level before posting publicly.
