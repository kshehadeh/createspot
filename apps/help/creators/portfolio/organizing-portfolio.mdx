Your portfolio is the list (or grid) of your submissions. You can influence how it’s presented by choosing a featured piece and, if the app allows, order or grouping.

## Featured piece

One submission can be highlighted as your **featured piece**. It often appears at the top of your profile or in a prominent spot so visitors see a representative work first. Set or change it in **Profile** or **Portfolio** settings; pick any of your existing submissions. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) for related options.

## Order of submissions

Depending on the app:

- **Default order** — Often newest first (most recent submission at the top).
- **Custom order** — If supported, you may be able to drag and drop or choose an order in portfolio settings.

If you don’t see an order option, the app may use a fixed sort (e.g. by date). Your featured piece can still stand out regardless of order.

## Grouping and filters

Portfolios may be shown as a single list or grid. Filtering by prompt or date might be available when viewing your portfolio. Use the filters to focus on a specific prompt or period.

## What others see

When your profile is public, visitors see your portfolio in the order and layout the app uses, with your featured piece emphasized. When private, your portfolio isn’t visible to the public. See [Public vs. Private Profiles](/creators/profile/public-vs-private).
