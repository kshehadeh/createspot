Your "space" is the set of options that control how your profile and work are presented and protected.

## Featured piece

Choose one submission to highlight on your profile. It appears prominently so visitors see a representative work first. You can change it anytime from your portfolio or profile settings.

## Protections

You can turn on options to protect your work:

- **Download prevention** — Restrict or discourage downloading of your images.
- **Watermarking** — Optional watermark so shared work is attributed to you.
- **AI training opt-out** — Signal that your work should not be used for AI training. See [A Word About AI](/a-word-about-ai) for more context.

These settings apply to how your work is displayed and to metadata that helps respect your preferences.

## Tutorials

If the app offers tutorials or hints, you can often control whether they appear for you (e.g. first-time setup or specific flows). Check profile or account settings for tutorial/hint toggles.

## Your language

Set your preferred language for the interface and, where applicable, for your profile and content. This affects labels, navigation, and any localized help.

## Email preferences

Control when you receive emails. Options include:
- **Someone follows you** — When someone new follows you.
- **New work from people you follow** — When someone you follow adds new work to their portfolio.

See [Followers and following](/creators/community/followers-and-following) for more on the community feature.

## Where to change these

Open **Profile** from the menu (top right), then **Edit profile**. Your featured piece, protections, tutorials, and language are in the profile editor. Change any option and save; updates apply to your profile and how your work is shown.
