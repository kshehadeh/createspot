In **Map view** (sometimes called **Path view**), an exhibit’s pieces are arranged in a spatial or path-based layout. You move through the exhibit by following the path or exploring the map; each stop is a piece.

## How it works

- **Map or path** — Pieces are placed on a map (e.g. by location) or along a path (e.g. a timeline or story). You navigate by panning/zooming the map or stepping along the path.
- **Each stop** shows one submission. Click or tap to view it in detail (lightbox or detail page). You can then go to the next stop or back to the map/path.
- **Discovery** — This view emphasizes sequence or geography rather than a flat grid, so it can feel more like a walk or a journey through the exhibit.

## When Map view is used

Admins enable Map (or Path) view when creating or editing an exhibit. If you see a map or path when you open an exhibit, that exhibit has Map view enabled. See [Exhibit View Types](/administration/exhibits/exhibit-view-types) for admin configuration.

## Compared to Grid

- **Grid** — Many pieces at once; scroll and click. Best for quick scanning.
- **Map** — One or a few pieces in context; follow the path or explore. Best for a guided or spatial experience.

Some exhibits offer both; use the view switcher to choose.
