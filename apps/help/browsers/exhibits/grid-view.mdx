In **Grid view**, an exhibit’s pieces are shown in a grid of thumbnails or cards. You scroll to see more and click to open a piece in detail.

## How it works

- **Layout** — Pieces appear in rows and columns. The grid may be responsive (fewer columns on small screens, more on large).
- **Each cell** usually shows one submission: image (if any), title or caption, and sometimes the creator’s name or a link to their profile.
- **Click or tap** a piece to open it in a lightbox or on a detail page. From there you can view full size, see the creator, and sometimes leave feedback.

## Scrolling and loading

- As you scroll down, more pieces may load (infinite scroll) or you may see “Next page” / pagination. Behavior depends on app design.
- Use the grid to quickly compare many pieces and jump to the ones that interest you.

## When Grid view is used

Admins can set an exhibit to use Grid view (or both Grid and Map). If you see a grid when you open an exhibit, that exhibit has Grid view enabled. See [Exhibit View Types](/administration/exhibits/exhibit-view-types) for how admins configure this.
