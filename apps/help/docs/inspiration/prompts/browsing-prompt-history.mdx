Your **prompt history** is the set of submissions you’ve made in response to past (and current) weekly prompts. You can browse it to see what you’ve created over time.

## Where to find it

- **Inspiration** or **Prompts** — Look for “My submissions,” “My prompt history,” or “History.”
- **Profile / Portfolio** — Your portfolio lists all your submissions; some views let you filter or group by prompt or week.

You may see a list of weeks or prompts; open one to see your submission for that week.

## What you’ll see

- For each prompt (or week), you’ll see the three-word prompt and the piece you submitted (if any).
- You can open a piece to view it full size, edit it (if allowed), or remove it. See [Working with your submissions](/creators/portfolio/working-with-submissions).

## Uses

- **Review your work** — See how you’ve responded to different prompts over time.
- **Edit or remove** — Fix or delete a past submission if the app allows.
- **Revisit prompts** — Get ideas from past themes for future work.
