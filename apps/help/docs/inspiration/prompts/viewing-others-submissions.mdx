Each weekly prompt has a gallery of submissions from all creators who responded. You can browse these to discover work and see how others interpreted the same three words.

## Where to find prompt galleries

- **Inspiration** or **Prompts** — Open the current or a past prompt. You’ll see a gallery (often grid) of submissions.
- **Current week** — The active prompt is usually highlighted on the home page or in Play/Inspiration.

## What you’ll see

- **Grid or list** of pieces — Each card or row is one submission: image (if any), title/caption, and creator. Click or tap to open in lightbox or on a detail page.
- **Creator links** — From a piece you can go to the creator’s profile to see more of their work.
- **Reactions and comments** — If the app supports them, you can like or comment (when signed in). See [Getting feedback for your work](/creators/portfolio/getting-feedback) from a creator’s perspective.

## Browsing past prompts

Past prompts are usually listed by week or date. Open any week to see that prompt’s gallery. Submissions are read-only for past prompts; you can’t add new ones, but you can view and explore.

## Respecting creators

Creators may have [protections](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) on their work (e.g. download prevention, AI opt-out). Don’t download or reuse others’ work without permission. See [A Word About AI](/a-word-about-ai).
