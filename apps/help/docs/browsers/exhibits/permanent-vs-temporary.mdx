Exhibits can be **permanent** (always visible) or **temporary** (visible only between a start and end date). Admins set these when creating or editing exhibits.

## Permanent exhibits

- **No end date** (or an end date far in the future). They stay visible so long as the app is configured that way.
- Good for flagship collections, “best of” galleries, or ongoing showcases.
- Visitors can rely on them always being there when they browse.

## Temporary exhibits

- **Start and end dates** define when the exhibit is visible. Before the start date and after the end date, the exhibit is hidden from the main browse experience.
- Good for themed weeks, seasonal shows, or time-limited campaigns.
- After the end date, the exhibit may still exist in the system (e.g. for admins or history) but won’t appear in public exhibit lists unless the app supports “past exhibits” or similar.

## What you see as a browser

- On the **exhibits** or **browse** page you’ll see exhibits that are currently “active” (between their start and end dates, or permanent).
- Temporary exhibits appear when their window is open and disappear when it closes. Permanent exhibits are always listed (unless an admin later makes them temporary or removes them).

For how admins set these dates, see [Start and End Dates](/administration/exhibits/start-end-dates).
