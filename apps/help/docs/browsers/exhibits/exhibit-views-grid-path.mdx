Exhibits can be viewed in different layouts. The two main options are **Grid** and **Path** (often called **Map** view). The exhibit’s settings determine which views are available.

## Grid view

- Pieces are shown in a **grid** (rows and columns of thumbnails or cards).
- You scroll to see more; you can often click a piece to open it in a lightbox or detail page.
- Best for scanning many pieces quickly and comparing at a glance.

See [The Grid View](/browsers/exhibits/grid-view) for more detail.

## Map view (path view)

- Pieces are shown in a **spatial or path-based** layout — e.g. on a map or along a path.
- You move through the exhibit by following the path or exploring the map. Each stop is a piece.
- Best for a more narrative or exploratory experience, or when location matters.

See [The Map View](/browsers/exhibits/map-view) for more detail.

## Switching views

If the exhibit supports both views, a toggle or menu (e.g. “Grid” / “Map” or “Path”) lets you switch. If only one view is enabled for that exhibit, you’ll see that view only. Admins choose view types when configuring exhibits; see [Exhibit View Types](/administration/exhibits/exhibit-view-types).
