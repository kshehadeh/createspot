Badges are achievements or recognition shown on your profile. They can reflect activity, milestones, or roles.

## What badges can show

- **Activity** — e.g. number of submissions, weeks participated.
- **Roles** — e.g. featured artist, curator, when assigned by admins.
- **Milestones** — e.g. first prompt, first exhibit feature.

Exact badge types depend on how Create Spot is configured. Check your profile or the app’s badge list to see what’s available.

## Where badges appear

Badges typically appear on your public profile (when your profile is public). They may show as icons or labels next to your name or in a dedicated section. See [Public vs. Private Profiles](/creators/profile/public-vs-private) for how visibility affects what others see.

## Earning badges

Most badges are earned automatically (e.g. after a certain number of submissions). Some, like “Featured artist” or “Curator,” are assigned by administrators. See [Curators vs. Featured Artists](/administration/exhibits/curators-vs-featured-artists) for admin-side roles.

You don’t need to do anything special to “claim” automatic badges; they update as you meet the criteria.
