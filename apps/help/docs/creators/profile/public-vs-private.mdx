You can choose whether your profile and portfolio are visible to everyone or only to you (and optionally people you allow).

## Public profile

When your profile is **public**:

- Your profile page (bio, links, featured piece) is visible to anyone.
- Your portfolio and submissions that you've made public can be seen in exhibits and prompt galleries.
- You appear in browse and discovery surfaces for art lovers and other creators.

Use this when you want to be discoverable and share your work with the community.

## Private profile

When your profile is **private**:

- Your profile and portfolio are not listed or visible to the general public.
- Your work may still be associated with prompts or exhibits only in ways you've explicitly allowed (e.g. anonymous or unlisted).
- You can still use the app to submit and manage your work; only visibility to others is restricted.

Use this when you want to create and organize work without being discoverable yet, or when you prefer a smaller audience.

## Changing visibility

Switch between public and private in your **Profile** or **Account** settings. The change applies to your profile and to how your existing submissions are shown in public areas.
