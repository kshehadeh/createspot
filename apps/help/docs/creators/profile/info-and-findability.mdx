Your profile can include a short description and links so visitors can learn about you and find you elsewhere.

## What to add

- **Bio or about text** — A few sentences about you and your work. This appears on your public profile.
- **Links** — Website, social profiles, or other places people can find you (e.g. portfolio, Instagram, Twitter). Add only what you're comfortable sharing publicly.

## Where it appears

This information is shown on your public profile page when your profile is set to public. See [Public vs. Private Profiles](/creators/profile/public-vs-private) for visibility options.

## Tips

- Keep your bio concise; you can always expand it later.
- Use working links; broken links can be removed or updated in profile settings.
