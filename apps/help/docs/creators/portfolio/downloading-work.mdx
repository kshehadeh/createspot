You can usually download or export your own submissions so you have a copy outside the app.

## How to download your work

- **From a single submission** — Open the piece (e.g. in your portfolio or in lightbox view). Look for a **Download** or **Save** option. Use it to save the image or content to your device.
- **From portfolio** — Some apps offer “Download all” or “Export portfolio” in portfolio or account settings. That may produce a zip or a set of files for your submissions.

Exact labels and locations depend on the app. If you don’t see Download, check the piece’s menu (e.g. three dots) or the portfolio/account area.

## What you get

- **Images** — Typically the same file or a display-size version that was uploaded. Watermarks, if you enabled them, may be included. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) for protection options.
- **Text** — If the submission is text-only, you may be able to copy it or export it as text.

## Your protections and others’ work

Your own **download prevention** settings (if you turned them on) apply to how *others* see and download *your* work. They don’t prevent you from downloading your own submissions. Don’t download or reuse other creators’ work without permission; respect their protections and preferences. See [A Word About AI](/a-word-about-ai).
