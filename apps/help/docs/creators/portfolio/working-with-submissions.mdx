Submissions are the pieces you add in response to weekly prompts. You can create new ones, edit existing ones (where allowed), and manage what appears in your portfolio.

## Adding a submission

1. Go to the current week’s prompt (e.g. from **Play** or **Inspiration**).
2. Choose **Submit** or **Add your work**.
3. Upload a photo or add text as required by the prompt type.
4. Add an optional title or caption if the form allows.
5. Submit. The piece is saved and linked to that prompt and to your profile.

You can submit to the current prompt while it’s active. Past prompts may be view-only depending on app settings.

## Editing a submission

If the app allows edits after submission:

- Open the submission (from your portfolio or prompt history) and use **Edit**.
- Change the image, text, or caption as needed and save.

Some fields (e.g. which prompt it’s tied to) may not be editable after submit. If you don’t see Edit, that submission may be locked.

## Removing a submission

You can usually remove a submission from your portfolio or from the prompt. Use **Delete** or **Remove** on the submission. Confirm the action; removal is typically permanent. The piece will no longer appear in your portfolio or in that prompt’s gallery.

## Submissions and your profile

All your submissions form your portfolio. Your profile’s **featured piece** can be set to one of these. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) and [Organizing your portfolio](/creators/portfolio/organizing-portfolio).
