Create Spot distinguishes between **admins** and **users** (sometimes called “members” or “creators”). Roles determine what you can do in the app and in the dashboard.

## User (member / creator)

- **Sign in** and use the app as a creator or art lover.
- **Profile and portfolio** — Edit profile, submit to prompts, organize portfolio, set protections.
- **Browse** — View exhibits, prompt galleries, and other creators’ work.
- **No access** to admin-only areas: user management, exhibit configuration, prompt creation, or notification manager.

## Admin

- Everything a user can do, plus:
- **User management** — View users, see stats, assign roles (if supported), delete accounts. See [Managing Users](/administration/users) and [Viewing User Stats](/administration/users/viewing-user-stats), [Deleting Users](/administration/users/deleting-users).
- **Exhibits** — Create and edit exhibits, set dates, view types, featured submissions, curators and featured artists. See [Managing Exhibits](/administration/exhibits).
- **Prompts** — Create and update weekly prompts. See [Prompts](/administration/prompts).
- **Notification manager** — Configure or send notifications. See [Notification Manager](/administration/notification-manager).

## How you get admin access

Admin status is granted by an existing admin or by a system/super-admin. There is no self-service “become admin” option. If you need access, contact a current admin or the team that runs your Create Spot instance.

## Multiple admins

More than one user can have the admin role. All admins share the same capabilities unless the app supports finer-grained roles (e.g. “exhibit curator” only). Check your instance’s documentation or settings for role options.
