Admins can delete user accounts when necessary (e.g. abuse, spam, or at the user’s request). Deletion is a serious action and usually affects the user’s profile, portfolio, and possibly their submissions in prompts and exhibits.

## When to delete

- **User request** — The user asks for their account and data to be removed (e.g. for privacy or leaving the platform).
- **Policy violation** — After review, you decide to remove an account for terms-of-service or code-of-conduct violations.
- **Spam or abuse** — Clear spam or abusive accounts that shouldn’t remain in the system.

Prefer warnings or temporary restrictions when appropriate; use deletion when it’s the right remedy.

## How to delete

1. Open **Admin** → **Users** (or **User management**).
2. Find the user (search by name, email, or ID if available).
3. Open the user’s record and choose **Delete user** (or equivalent). Confirm the action.
4. Follow any additional steps your instance requires (e.g. typing the username to confirm).

## What happens

- **Account** — The user can no longer sign in; their profile and account data are removed or anonymized.
- **Submissions** — Behavior varies: submissions may be deleted, anonymized (e.g. “Deleted user”), or left in place with the user unlinked. Check your app’s behavior or docs.
- **Exhibits and prompts** — If the user was a curator or featured artist, those references may break or be cleared. Fix exhibits as needed after deletion.
- **Irreversibility** — Deletion is typically permanent. Ensure you have a backup or export if you might need to restore or audit.

## Best practice

- Document the reason for deletion (e.g. “user request” or “ToS violation”) if your process allows.
- For user-requested deletion, respond within the timeframe promised in your privacy policy.
