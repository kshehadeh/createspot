title: "Featured Submissions"
description: "Highlight specific pieces in an exhibit."
---

Admins can **feature** certain submissions within an exhibit so they’re emphasized (e.g. shown first, larger, or in a “featured” section). This helps curate the experience without removing other pieces.

## What “featured” means

- **In the exhibit** — Featured submissions are still part of the exhibit; they’re just given prominence. Typical options:
  - Shown at the top or in a dedicated “Featured” block.
  - Larger or more prominent in grid or path view.
- **Selection** — You choose which existing submissions in the exhibit to mark as featured. The number of featured pieces may be limited (e.g. 3–10) depending on the app.

## How to set featured submissions

1. **Admin** → **Exhibits** → Open the exhibit (create or edit).
2. Find **Featured submissions**, **Highlighted pieces**, or similar.
3. Add or select submissions (e.g. from a list of submissions already in the exhibit). You may be able to reorder them.
4. Save the exhibit.

## Tips

- Use featured submissions to tell a story or guide visitors to a few “don’t miss” pieces.
- You can change featured selections anytime by editing the exhibit. Reorder or replace as the exhibit evolves.
