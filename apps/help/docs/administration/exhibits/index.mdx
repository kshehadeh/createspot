As an admin you create and manage exhibits: set dates, choose view types, pick featured submissions, and assign curators and featured artists.

## Topics

- [Start and End Dates](/administration/exhibits/start-end-dates) — When an exhibit is visible (permanent vs. temporary).
- [Exhibit View Types](/administration/exhibits/exhibit-view-types) — Grid, Map (path), or both.
- [Featured Submissions](/administration/exhibits/featured-submissions) — Highlighting specific pieces in an exhibit.
- [Curators vs. Featured Artists](/administration/exhibits/curators-vs-featured-artists) — Roles and how they’re assigned.

Use the sidebar to open each topic.
