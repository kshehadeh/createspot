description: "Choose Grid, Map (path), or both for an exhibit."
---

When creating or editing an exhibit, you choose how visitors can browse it: **Grid**, **Map** (path), or **both**. View types control the layout and navigation experience.

## Grid

- Pieces are shown in a grid of thumbnails or cards. Visitors scroll and click to open pieces.
- Best for: many pieces, quick scanning, comparison. See [The Grid View](/browsers/exhibits/grid-view) for the visitor experience.

## Map (path)

- Pieces are arranged on a map or along a path. Visitors move through the exhibit spatially or step-by-step.
- Best for: narrative flow, location-based exhibits, or a more guided experience. See [The Map View](/browsers/exhibits/map-view) for the visitor experience.

## Both

- If the app supports it, you can enable **both** Grid and Map. Visitors use a toggle or menu to switch between views. The same submissions appear in both; only the layout and navigation change.

## Where to set it

- **Admin** → **Exhibits** → Create or edit an exhibit.
- Find **View type**, **Layout**, or similar. Select **Grid**, **Map** (or **Path**), or **Both**. Save the exhibit.

After saving, the exhibit will show in the chosen view(s) when visitors open it. See [Exhibit views (Grid vs. Path)](/browsers/exhibits/exhibit-views-grid-path) for how this is explained to users.
