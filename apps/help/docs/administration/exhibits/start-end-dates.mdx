title: "Start and End Dates"
description: "Set when an exhibit is visible (permanent or temporary)."
---

Exhibits can be **permanent** (always visible) or **temporary** (visible only between a start and end date). Admins set these when creating or editing an exhibit.

## Where to set dates

- **Admin** → **Exhibits** → Create or edit an exhibit.
- Look for **Start date** and **End date** (or **Permanent** checkbox). If “Permanent” is on, the exhibit has no end date (or an end date is ignored).

## Permanent exhibits

- Leave **End date** empty or check **Permanent**. The exhibit stays visible until you change it or remove it.
- Use for flagship galleries, “best of,” or ongoing collections.

## Temporary exhibits

- Set **Start date** — When the exhibit becomes visible in the browse list.
- Set **End date** — When the exhibit is hidden from the browse list. After that, it may still exist in the system for history or reuse.
- Use for themed weeks, seasonal shows, or time-limited campaigns.

## Behavior for visitors

- Only exhibits that are “active” (between start and end, or permanent) appear in the public exhibit list. See [Permanent Exhibits vs. Temporary Ones](/browsers/exhibits/permanent-vs-temporary) for the browser perspective.
- Changing dates after creation updates visibility immediately (after save). You can extend a temporary exhibit by moving the end date forward.
