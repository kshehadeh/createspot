Exhibits can have **curators** and **featured artists**. These are roles or labels assigned by admins to users; they affect how people are presented in relation to an exhibit (and sometimes what they can do).

## Curators

- **Role** — A curator is someone who helps shape or manage the exhibit (e.g. selects work, order, or theme). The exact permissions depend on the app: some instances let curators add/remove pieces or change order; others use “curator” only as a visible credit.
- **Assignment** — Admins assign curator(s) when creating or editing an exhibit. You select one or more users and give them the curator role for that exhibit.
- **Visibility** — Curators may be shown on the exhibit page (e.g. “Curated by …”) so visitors know who shaped it.

## Featured artists

- **Role** — A featured artist is a creator whose work is highlighted in the context of the exhibit. It’s a recognition label (and sometimes a badge on their profile). It does not automatically feature every piece by that artist; you still choose [featured submissions](/administration/exhibits/featured-submissions) if you want specific pieces emphasized.
- **Assignment** — Admins assign featured artist(s) for an exhibit. You select users; they get the “featured artist” label for that exhibit (and possibly a badge). See [Badges](/creators/profile/badges) for how badges appear to users.
- **Use case** — Good for “artist of the week” or “spotlight” exhibits where you want to call out certain creators.

## Difference in short

- **Curator** — Involved in putting the exhibit together; may have edit rights or just credit.
- **Featured artist** — Creator whose involvement is highlighted; often gets a badge or label. Their individual pieces can also be featured via [Featured Submissions](/administration/exhibits/featured-submissions).

## Where to set them

- **Admin** → **Exhibits** → Create or edit an exhibit.
- Look for **Curators** and **Featured artists** (or similar). Add or remove users and save.
