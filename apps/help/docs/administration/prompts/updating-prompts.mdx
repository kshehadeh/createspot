You can often edit a prompt after creating it, but some fields or actions may be restricted to avoid breaking existing submissions or fairness.

## What you can usually do

- **Fix typos** — Correct a word or the description before or during the active week. Best to do this early so submissions align with the intended theme.
- **Adjust description or subtitle** — Change supporting text if the app stores it. This doesn’t change the three words or the link between submissions and the prompt.
- **Extend or shorten the window** — Some instances let you change the start or end date. Extending gives more time to submit; shortening may cut off submissions, so use with care.

## What you often cannot do (or shouldn’t)

- **Change the three words after submissions exist** — If users have already submitted to “light, shadow, silence,” changing to different words would make those submissions mismatched. The app may lock the words once the prompt is created or once the first submission is in. If you must correct a word, do it before anyone submits.
- **Delete a prompt with submissions** — Deleting may be disabled, or the prompt may be “archived” so past submissions still reference it. Check your instance; prefer hiding or closing over hard delete.
- **Reuse the same week** — You typically can’t have two prompts for the same time range. Create a new prompt for a new week instead.

## Where to update

- **Admin** → **Prompts** → Open the prompt (by week or from a list) → **Edit**. Change allowed fields and save. If a field is read-only, the UI will indicate it (e.g. grayed out or with a lock icon).

## Best practice

- Review the three words and dates right after creating a prompt. Fix issues before the week starts or before the first submission.
