The **Notification manager** is the admin area where you configure and send notifications to users (e.g. email or in-app). Use it to announce new prompts, exhibit openings, or important updates.

## What you can do

- **Configure notification types** — Turn on or off certain notifications (e.g. “new prompt,” “your submission was featured,” “weekly digest”). Users may also have their own preferences; the manager often controls system-wide defaults or admin-triggered messages.
- **Send one-off messages** — Some instances let admins send a broadcast (e.g. to all users or to a segment) for announcements or maintenance.
- **Templates** — Edit or create templates for emails or in-app text so messages are consistent and on-brand.

Exact features depend on how your Create Spot instance is set up (e.g. Resend for email, in-app only, etc.). Check your admin UI for available options.

## Where to find it

- **Admin** → **Notifications** or **Notification manager**. You may see a list of notification types, send history, or template editor.

## Best practices

- Don’t over-notify; respect user preferences and unsubscribe options.
- Use clear subject lines and short, actionable body text.
- For broadcasts, consider segmenting (e.g. creators only, or users who haven’t submitted in a while) if the app supports it.
