This page covers Create Spot's stance and options related to AI and your work.

## Creator protections

Creators can control how their work is used. Options include protections against downloading and use in AI training. See [Creator protections](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) and related profile settings for how to configure these.

## Content and prompts

Weekly prompts are chosen to inspire human creativity. How you use tools (including AI) in your creative process is up to you; the goal is a supportive community for sharing and discovering work.

## More information

For technical details on protections and settings, see [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space) and [Building your profile](/creators/profile).
