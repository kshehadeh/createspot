Each week Create Spot publishes a three-word prompt. You can respond by submitting a photo or text (depending on what the prompt allows).

## Steps to submit

1. **Find the current prompt** — Go to **Play**, **Inspiration**, or the current week’s prompt from the home or nav.
2. **Choose “Submit” or “Add your work”** — You may be asked to sign in if you aren’t already.
3. **Add your piece** — Upload an image and/or enter text as the form allows. Add a title or caption if you want.
4. **Submit** — Confirm; your submission is saved and linked to that prompt and your profile.

## Rules and limits

- You can usually submit **one piece per prompt** (or per prompt per week). If you need to change it, use **Edit** on that submission before the prompt closes, if the app allows.
- **Current week only** — Submissions are typically accepted only for the active prompt. Past prompts are view-only.
- **Content guidelines** — Follow the app’s content policy. Inappropriate content may be removed.

## After submitting

Your piece appears in your [portfolio](/creators/portfolio) and in that prompt’s gallery. Others can see it when [viewing submissions for that prompt](/inspiration/prompts/viewing-others-submissions). You can [browse your prompt history](/inspiration/prompts/browsing-prompt-history) to see all your past responses.
