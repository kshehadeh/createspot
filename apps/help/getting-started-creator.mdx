Welcome to Create Spot. As a creator you can share work inspired by weekly prompts and build a portfolio others can browse.

## First steps

1. **Sign in** with your account (e.g. Google).

2. **Complete your profile** — Add a bit about yourself and how people can find you. See [Building your profile](/creators/profile) for details.
3. **Set up your space** — Choose a featured piece, protections, and language. See [Setup your space](/creators/profile/setup-your-space).
4. **Submit to prompts** — Each week has a three-word prompt; add your photo or text in response. See [Inspiration > Prompts](/inspiration/prompts) for how to submit and browse your history.

## Your Dashboard

After signing in, your **Dashboard** is your creative hub — a quick overview of your activity and the community.

The dashboard includes several sections:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **My Portfolio** | Your recent portfolio items. Work in Progress (WIP) submissions appear with a dashed border and amber "WIP" badge. Click any item to view or edit. |
| **Recent Critiques** | Feedback you've received on your work from other creators. |
| **Recently Visited** | Submissions and profiles you've browsed recently. |
| **People You Follow** | Updates from creators you're following. |
| **Badges** | Achievements you've earned for participating in the community. |

### Work in Progress in your Dashboard

When you mark a submission as **Work in Progress**, it shows in your dashboard with:

- A **dashed border** instead of solid
- An amber **WIP badge** in the corner
- The latest progression image as the thumbnail (if you have progressions)

This lets you track your evolving work alongside your completed pieces.
