Admins can view statistics for users to understand activity, growth, and engagement. Stats are typically available in the **Admin** area under **Users** or **User management**.

## What you might see

- **Per user** — Counts such as: number of submissions, prompts participated, last active date, profile visibility (public/private). Some dashboards show reactions received or comments.
- **Aggregate** — Total users, new sign-ups over time, active users (e.g. in the last 7 or 30 days), total submissions.

Exact metrics depend on how your Create Spot instance is configured. Look for tables or cards that list users and summarize their activity.

## How to use it

- **Support** — Identify very active or inactive users when helping with issues or outreach.
- **Moderation** — Spot unusual patterns (e.g. spam or abuse) by looking at submission counts or activity over time.
- **Growth** — Use sign-up and activity trends to see how the community is growing.

## Privacy

User stats are for admin use only. Don’t share individual user stats outside the admin team unless you have a clear policy (e.g. “top contributors” with consent). Follow your privacy policy and applicable laws when storing and using this data.
