The weekly prompt is three words. Good words are open enough to inspire many interpretations but specific enough to feel like a theme. Here are some ideas to keep in mind when selecting them.

## Variety

- **Mix senses and concepts** — e.g. one concrete (“stone”), one sensory (“quiet”), one abstract (“return”). That gives creators room to combine image and idea.
- **Avoid repeating** — Rotate themes (nature, emotion, place, time, texture, etc.) so weeks don’t feel samey. Check recent prompts before choosing.
- **Balance difficulty** — Some weeks can be more literal, others more abstract. A mix keeps the community engaged.

## Clarity and openness

- **Clear but not narrow** — Words should be understandable at a glance but not so specific that everyone does the same thing (e.g. “red balloon” might be too narrow; “float,” “red,” “sky” is more open).
- **Evocative over obscure** — Prefer words that spark imagination without needing a dictionary. One slightly unusual word can work if the other two are familiar.
- **Inclusive** — Choose words that many people can respond to regardless of location or background. Avoid jargon or overly culture-specific terms unless that’s the intent.

## Practical tips

- **Test in your head** — Imagine 3–4 different types of responses (photo, abstract, text, etc.). If you can, the prompt is likely flexible enough.
- **Keep a list** — Maintain a running list of word ideas and themes; pull from it when creating [new prompts](/administration/prompts/creating-prompts).
- **Ask the community** — Some instances let you solicit suggestions or run polls for future words. Use that if available.

You can always [update](/administration/prompts/updating-prompts) a prompt’s words only before any submissions exist; after that, prefer to leave the words as-is and plan the next week’s prompt with these ideas in mind.
