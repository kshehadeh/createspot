Admins create the weekly three-word prompts that drive submissions. Each prompt has a time window (e.g. one week) when users can submit.

## Steps to create a prompt

1. **Admin** → **Prompts** (or **Inspiration** in the admin area).
2. Choose **Create prompt** or **New prompt**.
3. **Enter the three words** — One per field or as a single line, depending on the UI. These are the theme for the week (e.g. “light,” “shadow,” “silence”).
4. **Set the week (start/end)** — Choose the date range when this prompt is active. Typically this is a week; only one prompt is “current” at a time. The system may auto-suggest the next open week.
5. **Optional** — Add a short description or subtitle if the app supports it. Some instances allow an image or link.
6. **Save** or **Publish**. The prompt becomes active when its start date is reached.

## Rules to keep in mind

- **One current prompt** — Usually only one prompt is “live” for submissions at a time. Overlapping windows may be disallowed. Check your instance.
- **Past prompts** — Once the end date passes, the prompt becomes read-only (users can view and browse submissions but not add new ones). You can still create prompts for future weeks.
- **Order** — Prompts are often listed by week or start date. New prompts appear in that list once saved.

## After creating

- Users see the new prompt when it becomes current (e.g. on Play or Inspiration).
- You can [update](/administration/prompts/updating-prompts) the prompt before or during its window if the app allows (e.g. fix a typo). Some fields may be locked after creation or after the first submission.
